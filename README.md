# HandiClip

Handiclip is a chrome extension to seamlessly paste texts/responses to complete your forms quicker !!

Handiclip gives an easy way to have all your important text content such as key notes, links, frequently used responses and so on in one place. Each saved text can be given a title to remember it by. You have the option to copy the content to the clipboard seamlessly with a click of button and also edit/delete any of the content from Handiclip.

What inspired to build this simple but very useful tool?
For example, consider online applications where you need to fill in your biodata manually. Filling it with your name, address, education, work experience etc manually could become cumbersome. Even storing all this necessary information in a notepad or sticky notes and selecting the content followed by ctrl-c followed by ctrl-v is also time killing. There comes Handiclip where you can store all text information for easy asscess and helps to simplify the process.
